Now you can fill in the credentials you received. The connect button will turn blue. Please click on it. You will get a confirmation... and you are done.

Repeat this on any other device you have Nomie running, using the same credentials and your devices will be kept in sync.

## Some Important Info

Please read the information below carefully so you understand what you can expect:

### Security

Your data is being synced encrypted, but stored unencrypted (which is the nature of CouchDB).

You will receive your private credentials via your email to ensure that it is indeed you who is requesting to subscribe.

Your credentials are stored encrypted.

### Support

I am offering this service because Nomie is the tool-to-go for me and I want as many people to also be able to use the tool. I offer the sync service for free and on best effort. So in case of problems or bugs, be a little bit patience with me üòÑ

If you did not use the service (sync your data) for more then 30 days, I will delete your subscription in order to manage server capacity. (you can always register again)

### Other things?

Well, I guess there is nothing more to explain.

As always...have fun with it!
